Notes during project
1.Tried to use style.classList and then .show instead of just the string show. 'style not needed'
2. How to access the individual CSS properties (without simply adding a class)
3. I struggled with change the background. I thought I would be able to simply use element.style.background = 'image' but I realized I needed to use 'url(img);
4. Had a bug in my code where I misspelled background. backgound vs. background
